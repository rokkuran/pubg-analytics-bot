# PUBG Analytics Discord Bot
Very much WIP bot for [Discord](https://discordapp.com/). Mainly for PUBG player/match analytics - examples and code in my other [repository](https://github.com/rokkuran/pubg-analytics).

Bot does work with simple test commands. Extension to PUBG analytics using their [API](https://documentation.playbattlegrounds.com/en/telemetry-events.html) in progress. 

## Match Damage Breakdown
Example of weapon/Vehicle damage breakdown for players nth match: `!pdmgn username n`. This is active and working in discord.
